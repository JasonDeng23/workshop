## Question 

In Anderson's 2008 Wired Article he describes how the data deluge is serving to make the scientific theory obsolete. Kitchen provides a rebuttal to Anderson's argument that theory is dead with his suppposition that in fact we have entered a fourth paradigm. What do you think? Do you believe theory is dead? Do you think we have indeed entered a paradigm shifting revolution for how we describe, analyze, and understand the world?


### Response to Anderson and Kitchen

I wouldn't necesarily say scientific theory is obsolete and that theory is dead. Kitchen argues that data is not simply just "arise from nowhere", and that there is still a scientific process and reasoning behind it. Analyzing our data requires algorithms and scientific reasoning that is based on previous findings and theories. As such, scientific theory is not obsolute, it just enters a new phase, aka a new paradigm. We still need to make sense of the data. It is just a better way for us to better explain and validate the world we live in, based on the theories and findings we already know. In Kitchen's words, data-driven science is a reconfigured version of the traditional scientific method, providing a new way in which to build theory.
