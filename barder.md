# Respone to Barder questions

### What is the Washington Concensus? How did it promise to improve on previous economic models? (6)

The Washington Concensus was a series of policy reforms proposed by the World Bank and IMF (international monetary fund). There were 10 policy reforms, including fiscal discipline, spending priorities, tax reform, market interest rates, and more. 

The Washington Concensus tried to free up markets, which supposedly was the reason why previous economic models weren't working was due to the fact that bad government polices "interfered with the proper functioning of markets", which resulted in a lower output than expected. By reducing the impact the government has on the market, the market then would be better able to flourish and reach its max potential.

### What did Barder mean by "resist fatalism"? Who is Norman Borlaug and what is the Green Revolution? (15)

While biological evolution seems to be mostly a "mechanical process", where the tempo and direction of evolution are determined by natural factors, we should not just be passive and accept the fact that nature controls evolution. We can in fact speed up or acclerate evolution through our own methods. Take the example of Norman Borlaug; he used cross breeding along with selective breeding to develop high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties. By doing so, he brought the Green Revolution which ultimately saved more than a billion people around the world from starvation.
