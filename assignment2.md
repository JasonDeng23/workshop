### Introduction

The purpose of this research is to explore and analyze methods of data science and sources of data that are currently not efficiently utilized enough for epidemiology of vector-borne illnesses throughout Southeast Asia (SEA). Much of the current analysis of vector-borne illnesses in SEA relies on collecting surveys or specific census data. Oftentimes, the data may be outdated or not fully comprehensive as a result of various low income nations who lack prioritization for such. Instead, a more contemporary source of data can be used: cell phones. As mobile phone adoption and usage continues to rise in lower-income nations, we are granted a unique way to track millions of individuals. Call-data records (CDRs) allow people to receive massive amounts of real time, accurate data which can then be used to analyze or generate patterns for whatever the situation requires. Additionally, gravity models allow for a different way of modeling and estimating human movement and how diseases spread.  My goal ultimately is to see how utilizing these techniques will provide a more contemporary and different way of tracking and predicting vector-borne illnesses. This work will build upon the already established research methodology of census data gathering and using GIS technology to produce relevant visuals. [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

### Human Development Topic

Vector-borne illnesses are difficult to combat due to the inherent nature of the disease. Vector-borne viruses and parasites like dengue and malaria, respectively, disproportionately plague many lower-middle income countries that are still developing, who are often overwhelmed and unable to successfully combat the illness. Illnesses like malaria can cause sickness and death, especially among young children. In 2016, malaria caused an estimated 216 million clinical episodes and 445,000 deaths[2]. Not only that, they can also impose significant financial burden on both the people and the government; malaria alone has slowed economic growth in Africa by up to 1.3 percent per year, and required an estimated 12 US billion dollars per year due to direct costs[1]. As such, disease control and elimination becomes essential in being able to develop as a nation. The inherent problem with vector-borne illnesses is not only identifying hotspots and coldspots, but also being able to track and predict how the virus moves. While carriers like mosquitos are being combated with insecticide-treated mosquito nets which target mosquito breeding grounds, human mobility also plays a big role in how the virus moves and infects others. Asymptomatic people can unknowingly be transfering the disease to many through day-to-day interactions, depending on the basic reproduction rate of the disease.

When it comes to which sustainable development goal is related to my topic, it’s simply goal 3, or to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. Addressing major diseases like malaria and tuberculosis is crucial in improving life expectancy, decreasing infant mortality, etc.  Being able to accomplish this SDG is critical in being able to progress as a nation, fight poverty, and end suffering. This is part of Amartya Sen’s definition of human development, where Sen mentions the importance of basic healthcare and mortality reduction as a driving factor behind growth, both economically but also in terms of freedoms. He highlights this with the example of China and India: both of these countries sought to improve themselves economically, but China was met with far greater success. How so? This is due to the fact that China not only improved education, but also much improved health conditions and healthcare. In essence, there is an interconnection between these two instrumental freedoms: in order to improve economically as a nation, better healthcare needs to be of priority.  

### Human Development Process

Many southeast asian countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos are still much in the works of developing. Traditionally, many southeast asian countries rely heavily on farming and agriculture for a source of income, partly due to lack of development and reliance on the monsoon seasons that dominate the area. The tropical and wet climate provides the ideal living conditions for mosquitos, which are one of the biggest carriers of viruses and parasites for many vector borne illnesses [4]. These factors combined with many others such as war, corrupt governments, and diseases results in the state of infrastructure being undeveloped and lacking in many areas. For Cambodia, data from the Humanitarian Data Exchange suggests that paved roads often do not reach the villages and rural areas where most of the population resides, in which they often use dirt or unpaved roads as a means of travel. Additionally, healthcare facilities often are situated among the main intrastate roads and near big cities, away from the rural and isolated areas, again revealing how many citizens lack access to proper facilities. Ultimately, this results in contagious diseases like malaria devastating many parts of these countries. As a result, being able to track malaria becomes a complex, adaptive process with many considerations. All the big and small interactions produce a constantly evolving and adaptive system, where each agent introduces alternate aspects to the epidemiology. Here, I will focus on human mobility. 

While mosquito populations are widely being combated with ITNs, or insecticide-treated nets, thus limiting possible means of transmission, human mobility also plays a big role. Why people migrate and move is dependent on a wealth of factors, whether it be social or economical. The “push and pull” factors for people in Cambodia include land development or lack of economic opportunities[5]. This means that there is movement both ways between urban, densely populated central areas and less populated rural areas: the rural population might move into the urban ones seeking jobs and opportunities for a more sustainable income, and others might move into newer settlements as land development opens previously isolated areas for commercial use[5]. In the scientific report done by Guyant et al.[5], they classified specific groups of people based on many factors, like how much they move, economic status, main residence, etc. It was found that people who were part of the “mobile population” (people who were at their main residence for less than 6 months at a time) were at the highest risk and vulnerability for malaria. Essentially, people who were moving a lot often did not have proper immune responses to malaria and thus would be the ones who are most likely to get sick and possibly carry the malaria parasite around. People of the migrant group were also classified to be predominantly of low income backgrounds and have a “low” (based on the verbage used in the study) knowledge of malaria/health services. Such migration and movement is an invitation for malaria transmission, especially considering the poor knowledge of malaria transmission and prevention. Moreover, there are three risks associated with local and regional movements between areas with different malaria risks:  1) people from high risk regions can go into low risk regions and bring malaria parasites with them, 2) people from low risk regions going into high risk regions are more susceptible to contracting the disease, and 3) people from different endemic regions can bring together genetically distant strains and introduce new, stronger novel strains [6].

The importance of tracking human mobility thus requires the need to not only see how people move over a span of months or years, but daily movements as well. After all, people are moving every single day like the commute to work, which for people in Southeast Asia might take anywhere from minutes to hours long[6]. Thus it raises the question: How can we accurately track human mobility at a local scale and model such relation in order to better predict and track malaria transmission?

### Data and Geospatial Data Science Methods

Currently, the main methods used in most studies about vector-borne illnesses in Southeast Asia revolve around taking various census data available from a country and applying that to GIS software to develop models and graphs. Some issues however come from the fact that in some countries, census data can be outdated by a few years. For example, in a 2016 scientific report [3], hotspots for the flu strain H5N1 were mapped with data of poultry populations from the National Veterinary Research Institute in Cambodia from 2010 and the Department of Livestock Development in Thailand from 2005. In Southeast Asia, call-data records are not being employed as much as they are in other areas, such as Africa. This is a possible gap that I’ve identified, but I will discuss that later. 
Being able to utilize call data records allow us to receive constant time updates to many pieces of crucial information. In a study done by Buckee et al. [6], the researchers sought to understand how human movement affects parasite transmission with malaria in Kenya. Each time a call is made, the CDR is stored in a nearby cell tower, allowing researchers to gain access to massive data sets. Each CDR can tell us who is calling, who are they calling to, the day and time of the call, the duration, and what cell tower the CDR is stored at. Because a cell tower’s service area is around 1-3 kilometers, it becomes a good approximation of the location of the caller. CDRs can be as precise as estimating a person’s location down to a city block in some cases[6]. With CDRs and locations of all the cell towers throughout Kenya displayed in various data layers, Buckee et al. layered parasite rate maps on top to highlight the correlations between the two. This is important because it allowed the researchers to be able to draw conclusions and correlations which previously were difficult to understand, and provide implications to future research in how to better track and combat the virus with respect to how people move. 

One commonly used spatial interaction model is the gravity model. It is called the gravity model because it is derived from Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation, which describes how there exists a force that attracts any two objects. This equation also has relevance when it comes to modeling how spatial entities react between each other; in this case, between human mobility and vector-borne diseases. In a generic form, a gravity model states that there is an attraction aij between two entities i and j which is in direct proportion to their “masses” and inversely proportional to the square distance separating them [7]. 

Barrios et al. used such gravity models to estimate the spatial spread of vector-borne illnesses. They looked at nephropathia epidemica (NE) and Lyme borreliosis (LB) in Belgium. The formulation of the gravity model used in their study looked like this: 

where “R” was the estimated risk index of NE and LB. The variables that the researchers chose to relate were surface covered by vegetation (V), estimation of population (P), and fraction of economic activities (F). The distance variable represents the average distance between urban areas U and surrounding vegetated areas. Vegetated areas were included in the equation because ticks carrying LB are found in a wide range of environments including mainly forested areas. The researchers noted that “economic activities” were included since foresters, hunters, farmers, etc., work in forested areas and thus carry that risk factor. Then, the equation was log-transformed into 

with a function f(R) to map risk indexes. Using this, the researchers found out that the Franco-Belgian border was at highest risk for NE, and LB was moreover spread throughout the country in terms of highest risk. When compared with visuals generated by a Empirical Bayesian Estimator (EBE) of risk, the gravity model and the EBE’s risk zones were shown to be within 1 standard deviation of risk values [7]. Thus, the researchers presented the “adequacy” and accuracy of the gravity model in spatial epidemiology. They were able to use the equation to relate the “attraction” or relation between vegetation systems and various human factors, and generated a functional risk index. 

### Discussion

After my research, I feel like I have a better understanding of what agents and factors go into vector-borne illness in relation to human mobility. Call data records and gravity models that were mentioned in the previous section have huge potential when it comes to epidemiology and control of vector-borne illnesses. Because human mobility is somewhat difficult to decisively model due to many varying factors and agents, CDRs allow us to compensate for that by skipping the theory and heading straight into analysis and results. In the Kenya Study by Buckee et al, they mentioned how utilizing CDRs can allow researchers to see unprecedented insights into human mobility and its relation to malaria transmission. The gap I found was how call-data records were not used as much as other data in Southeast asia epidemiology. Studies mainly relied on census data, followed up by rendering with GIS technology in order to generate visuals. While this method is by no means ineffective, census data sometimes may be outdated in some countries like Cambodia. Even the most updated census data can not provide the day-to-day constant updates that call-data records can, and in a situation like virus control and prevention, speed and efficiency becomes top priority. Additionally, gravity models can be utilized more in epidemiology of vector-borne illnesses in the SEA region as it allows for a better prediction of risk or relations between various agents while not requiring as big of a data set as say a national census. GMs can be used with a small proportion of data, then scaled up with prediction models. My proposed research questions would be are gravity models effective as a means for spatial epidemiology predictions for vector-borne diseases and could call-data records make census data redundant as a means for combatting forms of vector-borne illnesses.
