# Response to Selim Jahan's and Hans Rosling's 

In Selim Jahan's podcast "What is Human Development", Jahan challenges the idea that human development should be focusing on economic growth. Instead, it should be "of the people, by the people, and for the people". As nations continue to improve economically and increase GDP, the focus should be turned more into improving daily human life. By focusing not only economically but socially and politcally, human development can reach its max potential and improve standard of living. Part of this change from from the HDI, which measures how successful and developed societies are by not just considering GDP, but health and healthcare facilities, education, standard of living, etc. 

Hans Rosling claims that "tremendous social change...often precedes economic change‚Äù. Through a visual presentation of how various countries have improved since 1960, it can be seen that western nations like the USA and many European countries continued to have small improvements to their already great standards of living and economy (judged by GDP per capita and child survival rate), but many developing third world countries rapidly improved as well, to the point where they are close, if not on track, to the developed western nations. When talking about how social change came before economic change, one big example Rosling has is with China. First, Mao Zedong brought healthcare, then Deng Xiaoping brought the "money". It was with this that China exploded into mainstream success. Rosling also warned against averaging some countries. If you look at the data of countries as a single point, you will fail to get the full picture. The top 20% of Ugandan's overlap with the lowest 20% or so for South Africa, while the lowest 20% of Uganda trails way behind. How can humanitarian aid be properly distributed equally between the top 20% and lowest 20% if they are lumped together? In order to best aid human development, averaging must be avoided.
